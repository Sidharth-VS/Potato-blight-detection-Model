# Potato Blight detection using CNN
This project present a CNN based deep learning model built with pytorch to classify potato leaves into three categories<br>
i.  **Healthy**<br>
ii. **Early blight**<br>
iii. **Late blight**<br>
The model was trained on a dataset consisting of 2000 labelled records.<br>

# Model Architecture
#### The custom CNN includes
#### **2D Convolutional Layers** - Extracts Spatial features.
#### **Batch Normalization & Activation layer** - Normalizes feature maps and applies ReLU activation.
#### **Pooling layer** - Reduces spatial dimensions to downsample feature maps and retain key features.
#### **Fully Connected Layers**- Outputs final binary classification.


# Dataset information
This project utilizes the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village">Plant village dataset</a> from kaggle
